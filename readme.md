Motivation: I really loved Habitica's Pomodoro because I could keep track of info, but sometimes it deletes all data, and if I don't have a backup, I am done for. Anyway, I use the terminal a lot, and this seems like a much better option to me than Habitica's Chrome extension. I have used my own tool for over a week now. Sharing this anyway, even though I don't know if anyone would want to use a Pomodoro on CLI. I have some features like sound, history, and all. Will improve later when I have time. You could also contribute if you want to, and I appreciate that. To install: Clone the repo and do a `pip install -e .`. Then just type `clidoro` whenever you want.
